INTRODUCTION
============

The package senskernel-1.0 provides the following opportunity for users 
working at Linux-based computers:
  - Calculation of multi-modal surface wave dispersion and eigenfunctions 
    in flat isotropic elastic Earth model consisting of homogeneous layers. 
    Options for sphericity and attenuation corrections are included.
  - Calculation of phase velocity sensitivity kernels for the same model.
  - Calculation of group velocity sensitivity kernels for the same model.

Package includes three programs: SURF_PERTURB, PHV_SENS_KERNEL ,
GRV_SENS_KERNEL and C-shell script KERNELS.csh .

1. PACKAGE CONTENTS
   ================
The contents of the package are as follows:
README         this file
bin            contains of three binary 64-bit executable programs (OS RHEL 5.9)
               GRV_SENS_KERNEL, PHV_SENS_KERNEL, SURF_PERTURB,
               and script KERNELS.csh.
src            contains of program source codes
TEST1          contains of precomputed example test
TEST2          directory to run your own  installation

2.  INSTALLATION
   ================
   Use the gunzip and tar command to extract distribution contents.

     ...> gunzip senskernel-1.0.tgz
     ...> tar xvf senskernel-1.0.tar

This will yield a top level directory named senskernel-1.0 with an executable,
along with other miscellaneous files.
Go to senskernel-1.0/src directory and recompile, if necessary, all programs.
To do that execute the following coomands
   ...> make clean
   ...> make
   ...> make install

The resulting binary modules GRV_SENS_KERNEL, PHV_SENS_KERNEL and
SURF_PERTURB will be installed under senskernel-1.0/bin directory. 
In case of problems update Makefile properly.
The senskernel-1.0/bin directory originally includes binary modules compiled by 
gcc/gfortran v4.1.2 compiler under RHEL 5.9 (RedHat Enterprise Linux 5.9)
Operational System.

See an example of run in the directory TEST1 and try your own run
in directory TEST2.    

3. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
   ===================

   - 64-bit or 32-bit platforms
   - Linux Operation System, 
     currently tested on RHEL 5.x, 32 and 64 bit version under 
     gcc/gfortran v4.1.2
   - SUN OS Solaris
     currently tested on Solaris rel.5.7/5.8/5.10 cc/f77 WorkShop Compilers 4.2
   - Mac X 
     currently tested on OS 10.7 (Snow Leopard), gcc/gfortran v4.6.0
   - have to work under other Linux OS and compilers with minor changes.

4. TEST INSTALLATION
   =================
   Go to senskernel-1.0/TEST1 to see test results and after goto
   senskernel-1.0/TEST2 and follow README files.
   For more details see Senskernel.pdf in senskernel-1.0/doc directory.
